# Automator deployment — BitMiner

Project type: **vite**  
Build: `.: npx vite build --mode development`  
Developers: Kaelen Thorne, Lyra Van Dyk, Mint Reyes  
Base branch: `main`

## Summary

Kaelen Thorne, Lyra Van Dyk, and Mint Reyes completed the BitMiner cryptocurrency miner application. Kaelen planned and structured the Vite project with linear-gradient styling, navigation between 'Mine' and 'Convert' views, base64 email generation and base64 key generation. Lyra implemented the core features, auto-convert processing functionality, the terminal feed output using core variables [blab], [miner_identity_email], and [app_user_selected_amount], and PWA support. Mint verified and polished the code, ensuring zero console errors and robust error-handling.
