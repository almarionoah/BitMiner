# Automator deployment — BitMiner

Project type: **vite**  
Build: `.: npx vite build --mode development`  
Developers: Kaelen Thorne, Lyra Van Dyk, Mint Reyes  
Base branch: `main`

## Summary

Kaelen Thorne planned the layout and linear-gradient design system. Lyra Van Dyk built the core mining engine generating base64 miner identity emails and key combinations (blab), conversion processing using miner_identity_email, blab, and app_user_selected_amount, real-time feed terminal, auto-convert mode, and PWA functionality. Mint Reyes validated build configuration, data processing, input handling, and terminal outputs.

## Files changed

- `index.html` — Updated index.html with meta description, theme color, manifest link, and stylesheet reference for the BitMiner PWA application.
- `public/manifest.json` — Created web app manifest for PWA app installation functionality.
- `public/sw.js` — Added service worker script to support PWA installation and offline caching.
- `style.css` — Created unified linear-gradient styling, theme variables, tab navigation styles, inputs, status badges, and terminal feed display.
- `main.js` — Created the main application logic handling mining, base64 encryption, key generation, blab output, conversion processing with required variables, feed terminal, tabs navigation, and PWA integration.
