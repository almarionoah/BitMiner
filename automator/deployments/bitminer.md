# Automator deployment — BitMiner

Project type: **vite**  
Build: `.: npx vite build --mode development`  
Developers: Kaelen Thorne, Lyra Van Dyk, Mint Reyes  
Base branch: `main`

## Summary

Implemented the full BitMiner cryptocurrency mining and conversion application according to engineering blueprints. Kaelen Thorne structured the modular architecture and defined the dual-menu layout ('Mine' and 'Convert'). Lyra Van Dyk implemented the mining and conversion processing pipeline using linear-gradient visual design, base64 email and key generators, automatic feed terminal output for each singular base64 blab combination, and integrated the core variables [blab], [miner_identity_email], and [app_user_selected_amount], alongside auto-convert and PWA capabilities. Mint Reyes reviewed and verified input validation, responsive CSS tokens, and clean Vite build compliance.

## Files changed

- `index.html` — Complete index.html providing the dual-menu layout ('Mine' and 'Convert'), mining visualizer, conversion inputs with core identity variables, global stats counter, real-time feed terminal, and PWA integration.
- `style.css` — Complete style.css defining the linear gradient design system, dark cyber aesthetic, reactive glowing pulse indicators, terminal layout, and mobile-friendly responsive styles.
- `main.js` — Complete main.js implementing automated cryptocurrency mining, Base64 email and cryptokey generation, singular [blab] combination synthesis, conversion processing utilizing [miner_identity_email] and [app_user_selected_amount], auto-conversion hook, JSON export, and PWA registration.
- `manifest.webmanifest` — Web app manifest enabling installable PWA functionality.
- `sw.js` — Lightweight service worker supporting PWA installation and offline capabilities.
